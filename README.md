# Standard Coding Problems In C

I have tried to code some standard competitive problems and data structures in C

in the most understandable way possible.

##Some of the problems include :

AVL tree, BST, Connected Components in a graph, Dijkstra's Algo, Prim's Algo, Segment Tree etc.

Feel free to contribute,

Cheers :D
